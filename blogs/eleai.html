    This week's patch brings an AI to play against as well as a load of bug fixes and quality of life improvements!
    <br /><br />
    <h2>New!</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>The Basic AI has been added</li>
    	<li>Every game starts with 1 bot</li>
    	<li>The bot searches map until it sees an enemy, and then chases them down</li>
    	<li>Bots will destroy destructibles and jump over gaps</li>
    	<li>Bots are treated like players in mosts ways; if you aren't careful they can win a match</li>
    	<li>We plan on adding different bots with unique behaviours to the game, all of them non-cheating AI</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Fixes </h2>
    <ul>    	
    	<li>Lag related bug causing kill scores to become out of sync is gone</li>
    	<li>Jumping in the air no longer causes you to jump again upon landing</li>
    	<li>Beam weapons and Silencers now target properly</li>
    	<li>Beam weapons now follow their cooldowns and not your clients framerate</li>
    	<li>Animation has been slightly fixed</li>
    	<li>More roof colliders added in "Spaceship"</li>
    	<li>Player data should now save correctly</li>
    </ul>  
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>Default volume is now set to 10% to prevent ear explosions</li>
    	<li>The basement and its associated elevator have been sealed off in "House"</li>
    	<li>Some parts of "Icecap" have been smoothed down</li>
    	<li>Beam weapons have been rebalanced following their fix</li>
    </ul>
