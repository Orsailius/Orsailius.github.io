<p>Cube Tiers is a game where you Craft, Research, Mine and Explore your way through a 3D Environment composed of Cubes.
There are three different modes of play.</p>

<p>1) Carefree - This game mode has no monsters and lets you play the game at a laid back pace. In addition you get some extra starting supplies.</p>

<p>2) Normal - Normal game mode has monsters you can fight and weapons you can craft. In Normal you only start with a torch to help light your way.</p>

<p>3) Developer - Break all the rules and play as a Developer. You get access to cheats that let you unlock research and get all the items you want. Great for being creative!</p>
